/**
 * Domain model representing a Track within Player context.
 * Combines core track data with player-specific metadata and state.
 * 
 * Key Design Principles:
 * - Composition over inheritance (contains Track, doesn't extend it)
 * - Rich domain model with computed properties
 * - Single source of truth for player track state
 * - Immutable data structure with functional updates
