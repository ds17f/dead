Verify dependency injection chain works correctly\n4. Add any required @Provides methods for complex dependencies\n5. Update module documentation with clear dependency relationships\n6. Follow existing pattern from ConcertRepository binding\n7. Test DI configuration with integration tests",
      "verificationCriteria": "All repository dependencies resolve correctly. Singleton scoping prevents multiple instances. No circular dependencies detected. Integration tests pass with DI container. Documentation accurately reflects dependency relationships.",
      "analysisResult": "Complete Repository layer implementation for Grateful Dead Archive Android app with data mappers, caching strategy, and reactive Flow-based data streams. The implementation follows Clean Architecture with MVVM, uses Dagger Hilt for DI, and integrates seamlessly with existing Network and Database layers. Key focus on offline support, error handling, and performance optimization through proper caching strategies.",
      "summary": "Successfully completed DataModule Dependencies configuration with comprehensive Dagger Hilt bindings for all repository implementations. Enhanced existing bindings with detailed documentation explaining dependency relationships and circular dependency prevention strategies. All three repositories (ConcertRepository, DownloadRepository, FavoriteRepository) properly scoped as @Singleton with clear @Binds methods. Dependency injection chain verified to work correctly: DatabaseModule provides all required DAOs, DataModule binds repository interfaces to implementations, and repositories inject dependencies without circular references. Added comprehensive module documentation explaining singleton scoping benefits for consistent state management and memory optimization.",
