# V2 Database Design - Implementation Status

## Current Status: Core Design Mostly Complete ðŸ”„

The V2 database design has **mostly** reached completion for core music listening experience entities. Primary user workflows are largely covered, but some loose ends remain to be addressed.

## Completed Entity Design

### Core Music Data âœ…
- **ShowV2Entity**: Date-centric with search optimization, embedded library status
- **VenueV2Entity**: With aliases, URLs, and location data
- **RecordingV2Entity**: Simplified to essentials (source, rating, Archive.org metadata)
- **TrackV2Entity**: Composite key supporting multiple formats (MP3, FLAC, OGG) with download tracking

### Content Organization âœ…
- **CollectionV2Entity**: Metadata-driven collections (Dick's Picks, guest musicians, tours)
- **CollectionShowV2Entity**: Pre-populated junction table for build-time efficiency
- **UserReviewV2Entity**: MVP ratings/notes system (eventual Archive.org sync)

### User Activity Tracking âœ…
- **CurrentPlaybackV2Entity**: Singleton resume state with Spotify-like functionality
- **ShowPlaythroughV2Entity**: Show-level listening analytics and completion tracking
- **TrackPlayV2Entity**: Optional detailed track-level analytics (performance configurable)

## Architecture Completeness

### Core User Workflows - All Covered âœ…
1. **Browse & Search**: Date-centric search with year/month/yearMonth optimization
2. **Play Music**: Multi-format track support with download integration
3. **Resume Listening**: Intent-based resume system with Media3 integration
4. **Manage Library**: Embedded library fields (no JOINs), backup-friendly
5. **Rate & Review**: Separate review system independent of library membership
6. **Track Progress**: Comprehensive analytics foundation for recommendations

### Performance Design âœ…
- **Search-optimized**: Denormalized location data, song lists for LIKE queries
- **Multi-format support**: Composite keys handle MP3/FLAC/OGG efficiently
- **Minimal JOINs**: Library status embedded, critical data denormalized
- **Singleton patterns**: CurrentPlayback uses singleton for efficiency
- **Optional tracking**: TrackPlay can be disabled for dataset size management

### Integration Architecture âœ…
- **Media3 Strategy**: Bidirectional sync via QueueManager coordination
- **App Lifecycle**: Non-invasive resume, smart position tracking
- **Data Pipeline**: Build-time collection population, runtime activity tracking
- **Migration Path**: V1â†’V2 migration strategy documented

## Potential Future Enhancements

### Not Yet Designed (But Not Critical)
1. **PlaylistV2Entity + PlaylistTrackV2Entity**
   - User-created playlists with QR code sharing
   - Could be added when playlist feature is prioritized

2. **User Preferences/Settings Entities**
   - Beyond current app settings (DataStore)
   - Aggregate listening statistics for performance
   - Personalized recommendation tuning

3. **System Management Entities**
   - **SyncStatusV2Entity**: Track Archive.org data freshness
   - **MigrationTrackingV2Entity**: V1â†’V2 migration progress
   - **ErrorLogV2Entity**: System health and debugging
   - **CacheManagementV2Entity**: API response cache strategies

4. **Advanced Download Management**
   - **DownloadQueueV2Entity**: Separate from current track-level download flags
   - **DownloadHistoryV2Entity**: Track download patterns and storage usage

### Design Philosophy for Future Additions
- **Add when needed**: Don't over-engineer before requirements are clear
- **Maintain V2 principles**: Date-centric, search-optimized, minimal JOINs
- **Performance first**: Consider denormalization and singleton patterns
- **User-focused**: Prioritize core listening experience over system complexity

## Decision Points for Implementation

### Ready to Implement Now âœ…
All core entities are fully designed and documented with:
- Complete field specifications
- Relationship mappings
- Performance indices
- Integration strategies

### Can Be Added Later ðŸ“‹
- Playlist system when QR sharing feature is developed
- Advanced user preferences when recommendation engine is built
- System management entities when operational needs emerge
- Download queue management when advanced download features are required

## Recommendation

**Proceed with core entity implementation.** The current design covers all essential user workflows and provides a solid foundation. Additional entities can be designed and added incrementally as specific features are developed.

The V2 database design successfully achieves:
- âœ… Complete core music listening experience
- âœ… Performance-optimized architecture
- âœ… Clean separation of concerns
- âœ… Extensible design for future enhancements
- âœ… Migration path from V1

**Status: Ready for Implementation Phase**
