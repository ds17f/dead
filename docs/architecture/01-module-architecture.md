## Dependency Issues Analysis

### 1. Feature-to-Feature Dependencies (Moderate Issue)
```
feature:browse → feature:playlist
feature:playlist → feature:player
```
**Impact**: Reduces modularity, makes features harder to develop independently
**Recommendation**: Extract shared navigation/communication patterns

### 2. Implementation Dependencies in Features (High Priority Issue)
Multiple features depend directly on implementation modules:
```
feature:browse → core:data, core:database, core:network
feature:player → core:data, core:database, core:network  
feature:playlist → core:data, core:database, core:network
```
**Impact**: Violates dependency inversion principle, makes testing harder
**Recommendation**: Features should primarily depend on API modules

### 3. Missing API Abstractions
- No `core:database-api` - features directly access Room entities
- No `core:network-api` - features directly access network layer

### 4. Large Class Issue (Significantly Resolved)
Several classes exceed maintainability thresholds:
- ~~`DebugViewModel` - 1702 lines~~ **REMOVED**
- `PlaylistScreen` - 1393 lines  
- ~~`PlayerViewModel` - 1227 lines~~ **REFACTORED** to ~650 lines + focused services + unified LibraryService
- ~~`ShowRepositoryImpl` - 1132 lines~~ **REFACTORED** to ~960 lines + 4 focused services (including LibraryService)
- ~~`MediaControllerRepository` - 1087 lines~~ **REFACTORED** to ~400 lines + 3 focused services

## Architecture Strengths

### 1. Modern Android Practices

- ✅ Hilt dependency injection throughout
- ✅ StateFlow/Flow reactive programming
- ✅ Modern architecture components

### 2. Clean Architecture Principles  
- ✅ Proper layering with API abstractions

- ✅ Good separation of concerns
- ✅ Interface-based dependency inversion (where implemented)

### 3. Modular Design Benefits
- ✅ Feature isolation enables parallel development
- ✅ Clear module boundaries
- ✅ Testable architecture with DI
- ✅ Good build performance with parallel compilation

### 4. Service-Oriented Architecture (NEW)
- ✅ Large classes broken down into focused services following Single Responsibility Principle
- ✅ Unified LibraryService eliminates feature-specific service duplication
- ✅ MediaController service composition resolves architectural conflicts
- ✅ Centralized download and library operations with consistent behavior

## Recommendations for Improvement

### Priority 1: Reduce Class Complexity ✅ COMPLETED
```kotlin
// ✅ COMPLETED: Large classes successfully refactored
ShowRepositoryImpl → ShowRepository + ShowEnrichmentService + ShowCacheService + ShowCreationService + LibraryService
MediaControllerRepository → MediaController + MediaServiceConnector + PlaybackStateSync + PlaybackCommandProcessor  
DebugViewModel → Removed (1702 lines eliminated)
PlayerViewModel → PlayerViewModel + PlayerDataService + PlayerPlaylistService + LibraryService integration
```

### Priority 2: Fix Feature Dependencies
```kotlin
// Move features to API-only dependencies:
feature:browse → core:data-api (remove core:data, core:database, core:network)
feature:player → core:data-api + core:media-api (remove direct implementations)
```

### Priority 3: Reduce Feature Coupling
```kotlin
// Extract shared components:
core:navigation    // Shared navigation logic
core:communication // Event-based feature communication
```

### Priority 4: Add Missing APIs
```kotlin
// Consider adding:
core:database-api  // Database abstraction interfaces
core:network-api   // Network layer abstractions  
```
